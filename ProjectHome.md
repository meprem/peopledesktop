I wrote this application in my own spare time in Accenture for "Accenture RIA People" software development contest few years back. The contest was open to all Accenture employees. I enjoyed learning Adobe Flex/AIR/Cairngorm and writing this software. You won't be able to use this app unless you are a current Accenture employee because it needs enterprise credentials to connect to internal web services.

Features:-
> Employee Search
> Full Profile Display
> Daily News Feeds

If you are interested in cross-platform application development(using Adobe AIR) and want to develop a production grade Adobe AIR working app(which consumes SharePoint web-services) then you have come to the right place.

Uploaded for learning purposes!!! Good luck and Happy Coding:)
